<h2>SOAR asset setup</h2>
<p>
  It is not uncommon for enterprises to have a single mailbox configured where users can forward suspicious emails for
  further investigation. The ingestion feature in the Office 365 app is primarily designed to pull emails from such a
  mailbox and create containers and artifacts in SOAR.
</p>
<p>
  The first thing to do is create the Office 365 asset in SOAR and fill up the required parameters like <b>url,
    username, password</b>, and <b>poll_user</b>. The other values can be left in the default state for now. The same
  user can be used to log in/authenticate for the connectivity test and polling, just specify the same email address
  in <b>poll_user</b> and <b>username</b>.<br>

  </a>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  However, it's good practice to set the Label for the objects from this source to a 'NEW ENTRY' called <b>Email</b>.
  <br><br>

  </a><br><br>
  Once the Asset and Ingest parameters are filled, save the asset.

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>
  This app supports multiple types of authentication mechanisms. Currently, there are five ways to authenticate.
<ul>
  <li>Basic</li>
  <li>Azure</li>
  <li>Azure (interactive)</li>
  <li>Federated</li>
  <li>OAuth (client credentials)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  For <b>Azure</b>, <b>Azure (interactive)</b> and <b>OAuth (client credentials)</b> mechanisms, you will first need to
  create an application on the Azure AD Admin Portal. Follow the steps outlined below to do this:
<ul>
  <li>Navigate to <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">https://portal.azure.com</a> in a browser and log
    in with a Microsoft account.</li>
  <li>Select <b>Azure Active Directory</b> from the list of Azure services.</li>
  <li>From the left panel, select <b>App Registrations</b>.</li>
  <li>At the top of the middle section, select <b>New registration</b>.</li>
  <li>On the next page, give your application a name and click <b>Register</b>.</li>
  <li>Once the app is created, the <b>Overview</b> page opens up. Copy the <b>Application (client) ID</b>
    value shown here. Paste this value in the <b>Client App ID for the Azure/Fed AD/OAuth
      Authentication</b> asset configuration parameter.</li>
  <li>Under <b>Certificates & secrets</b> select <b>New client secret</b>. Note down this key somewhere secure, as it
    cannot be retrieved after closing the window. Provide this value in the <b>Client Secret for the
      Azure/Fed AD/OAuth Authentication</b> asset configuration parameter.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
Following are the instructions to setup different types of authentication.
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3 id="basic">Basic</h3>
      Basic is the most simple way to authenticate. All you need to provide to this is Username and Password.<br>
      <b>NOTE:</b> Microsoft is going to permanently disable Basic Authentication for EWS. Hence, we recommend the customers to
      switch from Basic to Azure Authentication mechanism. The default value of <b>Authentication Mechanism to Use</b>
      asset configuration parameter is therefore changed to <b>Azure</b>. We will be maintaining the <b>Basic</b> option
      for backward compatibility and for any legacy users. As the 'trace email' action uses Basic authentication, it
      will not be functional after Microsoft disables Basic authentication.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="azure">Azure</h3>
      To use this authentication mechanism, you will have to add some permissions to the app you created earlier. Follow
      the steps outlined below to do this:
    <ul>
      <li>Under <b>API Permissions</b> Click on <b>Add a permission</b>.</li>
      <li>Under the <b>Select an API</b> section, select <b>APIs my organization uses</b>.</li>
      <li>Search for the <b>Office 365 Exchange Online</b> keyword in the search box and click on the displayed option
        for it.</li>
      <li>Provide the following Delegated permissions to the app.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>EWS.AccessAsUser.All</li>
        <li>Mail.Read</li>
        <li>Mail.Read.All</li>
        <li>User.ReadBasic.All (Only required if the asset is configured to use impersonation)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>After making these changes, click <b>Add permissions</b> at the bottom of the screen, then click <b>Grant
          admin consent for SOAR</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Azure (interactive)</h3>
      To use this authentication mechanism, you will have to add some permissions to the app you created earlier. Follow
      the steps outlined below to do this:
    <ul>
      <li>Under <b>Authentication</b>, select <b>Add a platform</b>. In the <b>Add a platform</b> window, select
        <b>Web</b>. The <b>Redirect URIs</b> should be filled right here. You will obtain the redirect URI from the
        <b>POST incoming for EWS Office 365 to this location</b> asset configuration parameter.<br> The
        URI should look similar to this:
        https://&lt;soar_host&gt;/rest/handler/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/&lt;asset_name&gt;<br>
        Once the Redirect URI is filled, click <b>Configure</b>.
      </li>
      <li>Under <b>API Permissions</b> Click on <b>Add a permission</b>.</li>
      <li>Under the <b>Select an API</b> section, select <b>APIs my organization uses</b>.</li>
      <li>Search for the <b>Office 365 Exchange Online</b> keyword in the search box and click on the displayed option
        for it.</li>
      <li>Provide the following Delegated permissions to the app.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>EWS.AccessAsUser.All</li>
        <li>Mail.Read</li>
        <li>Mail.Read.All</li>
        <li>User.ReadBasic.All (Only required if the asset is configured to use impersonation)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>After making these changes, click <b>Add permissions</b> at the bottom of the screen, then click <b>Grant
          admin consent for SOAR</b>.</li>
      <li>Azure adds <b>Microsoft Graph's User.Read</b> permission to the app by default. Please confirm its presence
        under the Configured permissions list. If not added, you can manually click on <b>Add a permission</b> and
        follow the below steps:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Under the <b>Select an API</b> section, select <b>Microsoft APIs</b>.</li>
        <li>Select <b>Microsoft Graph</b> from the list.</li>
        <li>Provide the <b>User.Read</b> Delegated permission to the app.</li>
        <li>After making these changes, click <b>Add permissions</b> at the bottom of the screen, then click <b>Grant
            admin consent for SOAR</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul><br>
    <p>
      <b>Azure Interactive</b> is different because it will prompt the user to log in through Microsoft's portal during
      Test Connectivity, meaning you do not need to enter your password in the asset configuration. Instead:
    <ul>
      <li>Run <b>TEST CONNECTIVITY.</b></li>
      <li>You will be asked to open a link in a new tab. Open the link in the same browser window so that you are logged
        into Splunk SOAR for the redirect.</li>
      <li>Proceed to login to the Microsoft site.</li>
      <li>You will be prompted to agree to the permissions requested by the App.</li>
      <li>If all goes well the browser should instruct you to close the tab.</li>
      <li>Now go back and check the message on the Test Connectivity dialog box, it should say Connectivity test passed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE: Do make sure the base URL is configured for the SOAR instance. You can check it here: Administration > Company Settings > Info.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>OAuth (client credentials)</h3>
      To use this authentication mechanism, you will have to add some permissions to the app you created earlier. Follow
      the steps outlined below to do this:
    <ul>
      <li>Under <b>API Permissions</b> Click on <b>Add a permission</b>.</li>
      <li>Under the <b>Select an API</b> section, select <b>APIs my organization uses</b>.</li>
      <li>Search for the <b>Office 365 Exchange Online</b> keyword in the search box and click on the displayed option
        for it.</li>
      <li>Provide the <b>full_access_as_app</b> Application permission to the app.</li>
      <li>After making these changes, click <b>Add permissions</b> at the bottom of the screen, then click <b>Grant
          admin consent for SOAR</b>.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>NOTE: Make sure the <b>Use Impersonation</b> option is enabled in the asset while using this authentication mechanism. Once it is enabled, you should add email of the impersonating user to the action parameter wherever possible while executing an action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="federated">Federated</h3>
      The Federated Authentication setup is quite complicated and its documentation is out of the scope of this section.<br>
      NOTE: Federated Authentication has been tested in a limited fashion.
  </li>
</ol>

NOTE: The user must test the connectivity every time they switch between different authentication mechanisms.

<h2 id="impersonation">Impersonation</h2>
<p>
  If you wish to use a single login user to read and modify multiple mailboxes (of multiple users), proper
  permissions to allow impersonation must be enabled on the login user. If impersonation is not enabled/working, you may need to enable it by configuring the roles for the user.
<ul>
  <li>First, log in to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/">https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/</a> as an admin
    user</li>
  <li>Click on <b>admin roles</b> under the <b>permissions</b> section</li>
  <li>Press the '+' button on the top left to create a new role group</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Give the group a friendly name and description</li>
    <li>Add the role <b>ApplicationImpersonation</b></li>
    <li>Assign the user to the members of this group</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Click save, and wait. These changes will take a while to affect. You may need to wait up to an hour for
    impersonation to start working in the App.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Connectivity test</h2>
<p>
  Once the asset is saved, run Test Connectivity and make sure it passes. The Test Connectivity action attempts to read
  some information about the configured user's mailbox to validate the Auth parameters. Exchange Web Services API is
  used for all the actions. Impersonation is also used if configured.<br><br>
  <a href="/app_resource/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/img/testing_connectivity.png">
    <img src="/app_resource/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/img/testing_connectivity.png" />
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Now that the config is out of the way, let's delve into the two modes that ingestion can occur and the differences
  between them. One thing to note is that for every email that is ingested, a single container is created containing
  multiple artifacts.
<p>
<h2 id="poll_now">POLL NOW</h2>
POLL NOW should be used to get a sense of the containers and artifacts that are created by the app. The POLL NOW window
allows the user to set the "Maximum containers" that should be ingested at this instance. Since a single container is
created for each email, this value equates to the maximum number of emails that are ingested by the app. The app will either get
the oldest email first or the latest, depending upon the configuration parameter <i>How to ingest</i>. The date used to
determine the oldest or latest is what EWS calls <b>item:LastModifiedTime</b>. This value is different than the mail
creation time. For example, if an email that arrived a week ago, is moved from one folder to the folder being ingested,
its LastModifiedTime will be set to the time that it was moved.
</p>
<h2 id="scheduled_polling">Scheduled Polling</h2>
<p>
  This mode is used to schedule a polling action on the asset at regular intervals, which is configured via the INGEST
  SETTINGS tab of the asset. It makes use of the following asset configuration parameters (among others):

<ul>
  <li>Maximum emails to poll the first time</li>
  The app detects the first time it is polling an asset and will ingest this number of emails (at the most).
  <li>Maximum emails to poll</li>
  For all scheduled polls after the first, the app will ingest this number of emails.
  <li>How to ingest</li>
  Should the app be ingesting the latest emails or the oldest.
</ul>
<p>In the case of Scheduled Polling, on every poll, the app remembers the last email that it has ingested and will pick
  up from the next one in the next scheduled poll.</p>
<h2>How to ingest</h2>
<p>The app allows the user to configure how it should ingest emails on every scheduled poll either in the <i>oldest
    first</i> or the <i>latest first</i> order. Depending upon the scheduled interval and how busy the folder is, one of
  the following could potentially happen</p>
<ul>
  <li>oldest first</li>
  If the app is configured to poll too slowly and the folder is so busy that on every poll the maximum ingested emails
  is less than the number of new emails, the app will never catch up.
  <li>latest first</li>
  If the app is configured to poll too slowly and the folder is so busy that on every poll the maximum ingested emails
  is less than the number of new emails, the app will drop the older emails since it is ingesting the latest emails that
  came into the mailbox.
</ul>
For best results, keep the poll interval and <i>Maximum emails to poll</i> values close to the number of emails you
would get within a time interval. This way, every poll will end up ingesting all the new emails.<br>

<h2>Containers created</h2>
<p>
  As mentioned before, the app will create a single container for each email that it ingests with the following
  properties:
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  The email subject is used as the name of the container. If a subject is not present the generated name is set to the
  unique message ID that office 365 assigns to every mail in the mailboxes</br>
  <li>Source ID</li>
  The source ID of the container will be set to the unique message id.
  <li>Data Key</li>
  The Container dictionary contains a data section that looks like the following:
  <pre>"data": { "raw_email": "...Parsed Email....", "base64encoded": False}</pre>
  If the App decides to encode the raw_email in base64, the <i>base64encoded</i> key will be set to True
</ul>
<h2>Artifacts created</h2>
<p>
  The app will create the following type of artifacts:
<ul>
  <li>Email Artifact</li>
  The email addresses that are found in the ingested email will be added as a separate artifact. Any attached email will
  also be scanned and the address present in the attached email will be added as a separate artifact. The emails are
  added as custom strings in the cef structure in the following manner.
  <br>

  <a href="/app_resource/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/img/email_artifact.png">
    <img src="/app_resource/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/img/email_artifact.png" />
  </a><br>
  <li>IP Artifact
    <ul>
      <li>If <b>extract_ips</b> is enabled, any IPv4 or IPv6 found in the email body will be added, with one CEF per IP.
      </li>
      <li>Any IP addresses found in the email are added to the CEF structure of an artifact.</li>
      <li>The CEF for an IP is cef.sourceAddress.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hash Artifact - cef.fileHash</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If <b>extract_hashes</b> is enabled, any hash found in the email body will be added, with one CEF per hash.</li>
    <li>Any Hashes found in the email are added to the CEF structure of an artifact.</li>
    <li>The CEF for a hash is cef.fileHash.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>URL Artifact - cef.requestURL</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If <b>extract_urls</b> is enabled, any url found in the email body will be added, with one CEF per url.</li>
    <li>Any URLs found are added to the CEF structure of an artifact.</li>
    <li>The CEF for a URL is cef.requestURL.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Domain Artifact - cef.destinationDnsDomain</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If <b>extract_domains</b> is enabled, any domain found in the email body will be added, with one CEF per domain.
    </li>
    <li>Domains that are part of a URL or an email address are added to the CEF structure of an artifact.</li>
    <li>The CEF for a URL is cef.destinationDnsDomain.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vault Artifact
    <ul>
      <li>If the email contains any attachments, these are extracted (if <b>extract_attachments</b> is enabled) and
        added to the vault of the Container.</li>
      <li>At the same time, the vault ID and file name of this item is represented by a Vault Artifact.</li>
      <li>The same file can be added to the vault multiple times. In this scenario, the file name of the item added the
        second time onwards will be slightly different, but the vault ID will still be the same. However, there will be
        multiple artifacts created.</li>
      <li>Do note that the system does <i>not</i> duplicate the file bytes, only the metadata in the database.
      </li>
      <li>You will notice additional CEF fields <b>cs6</b> (value is the Vault ID) and <b>cs6Label</b>. These are added
        for backward compatibility only and will be deprecated in future releases. Please don't use these keys in
        playbooks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li><br>

</ul>
</a>
</p>

<h2>Guidelines to provide folder path parameter value</h2>
<p>This is applicable to 'copy email', 'move email', and 'run query' actions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To specify the complete path, use the <b>'/'</b> (forward slash) as the separator.</li>
  <li>If a folder name has a literal forward slash in the name escape it with a <b>'\'</b> (backslash) to differentiate.
  </li>
  <li>For example, to search in a folder named <b>test/exp</b> which is nested within (is a child of) <b>Inbox</b>, set
    the value as <b>Inbox/test\/exp</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preprocessing Containers</h2>
<p>
  It is possible to upload your own script which has functions to handle preprocessing of containers.
  The artifacts which are going to be added with the container can be accessed through this container as well.
  This function should accept a container and return the updated container. Also note that the name of this function
  must be <b>preprocess_container</b>.
<pre class="shell">
<code>
import urlparse


def get_host_from_url(url):
    return urlparse.urlparse(url).hostname


def preprocess_container(container):

    # Match urls like https://secure.contoso.com/link/https://www.google.com
    # We want to strip 'https://secure.contoso.com/link/', and instead create
    #  a URL artifact for 'https://www.google.com'
    url_prepend = 'https://secure.contoso.com/link/'
    domain_prepend = 'secure.contoso.com'

    new_artifacts = []

    for artifact in container.get('artifacts', []):
        cef = artifact.get('cef')
        url = cef.get('requestURL')
        if url and url.lower().startswith(url_prepend):
            url = url.replace(url_prepend, '')
            artifact['cef']['requestURL'] = url
            # Create a new domain artifact for this URL
            new_artifacts.append({
                'name': 'Domain Artifact',
                'cef': {
                    'destinationDnsDomain': get_host_from_url(url)
                }
            })

        domain = cef.get('destinationDnsDomain')
        if domain and domain.lower() == domain_prepend:
            # These are the wrong domains, ignore them
            continue

        new_artifacts.append(artifact)

    if new_artifacts:
        new_artifacts[-1]['run_automation'] = True

    container['artifacts'] = new_artifacts
    return container
</code>
</pre>
In this example, many of the URLs have 'https://secure.contoso.com/link' appended to the start of them.
These URL artifacts will be tough to use in a playbook without additional processing. On top of that, all
of the associated domain artifacts will be incorrect as well, since they will all point to 'secure.contoso.com'.
</p>

<h2>Port Information</h2>

  The app uses HTTP/ HTTPS protocol for communicating with the Office365 server. Below are the default ports used by
  Splunk SOAR.
