    <h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
    <p>
    This apps supports multiple types of authentication mechanisms. Currently, there are four ways to authenticate.
    <ul><li>Basic</li><li>Azure</li><li>Azure (interactive)</li><li>Federated</li></ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="basic">Basic</h3>
    <p>
    Basic is the most simple way to authenticate. All you need to provide to this is a Username and Password
    </p>
    <h3 id="azure">Azure</h3>
    <p>
    Azure authentication comes in two flavors. To use either of these, you will first need to create an application on the Azure AD Admin Portal. Follow the steps outlined below to do this:
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">https://portal.azure.com</a> in a browser and log in with a Microsoft account</li>
      <li>Select <b>Azure Active Directory</b> from the left side menu</li>
      <li>From the left panel, select <b>App Registrations</b></li>
      <li>At the top of the middle section, select <b>New registration</b></li>
      <li>On the next page, give your application a name and click <b>Register</b></li>
      <li>Once the app is created, the below steps need to be taken on the next page:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Under <b>Certificates & secrets</b> select <b>New client secret</b>. Note down this key somewhere secure, as it cannot be retrieved after closing the window.</li>
          <li>Under <b>Authentication</b>, select <b>Add a platform</b>. In the <b>Add a platform</b> window, select <b>Web</b>. The <b>Redirect URLs</b> should be filled right here. We will get <b>Redirect URLs</b> from the Phantom asset we create below in the section titled "Phantom asset for Azure".</li>
          <li>Under <b>API Permissions</b> Click on <b>Add a permission</b>.</li>
          <li>Under the <b>Select an API</b> section, select <b>APIs my organization uses</b>.</li>
          <li>Search for the <b>Office 365 Exchange Online</b> keyword in the search box and click on the displayed option for it.</li>
          <li>Provide the following Delegated permissions to the app.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>EWS.AccessAsUser.All</li>
              <li>Mail.Read</li>
              <li>Mail.Read.All</li>
              <li>User.ReadBasic.All (Only required if the asset is configured to use impersonation)</li>
              <li>After making these changes, click <b>Add permissions</b> at the bottom of the screen, then click <b>Grant admin consent for Phantom</b>.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Azure adds <b>Microsoft Graph's</b> User.Read permission to the app by default. Please confirm its presence under the Configured permissions list. If not added, you can manually click on <b>Add a permission</b> and follow the below steps:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Under the <b>Select an API</b> section, select <b>Microsoft APIs</b>.</li>
              <li>Select <b>Microsoft Graph</b> from the list.</li>
              <li>Provide the <b>User.Read</b> Delegated permission to the app.</li>
              <li>After making these changes, click <b>Add permissions</b> at the bottom of the screen, then click <b>Grant admin consent for Phantom</b>.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Phantom Asset for Azure</h3>
        When creating an asset for the <b>EWS for Office 365</b> app, place the <b>Application ID</b> of the app created during the previous step in the <b>Client App ID for the Azure/Fed AD Authentication</b> field. Then, after filling in other values, click <b>SAVE</b>.
<br><br>
After saving, a new field will appear in the <b>Asset Settings</b> tab. Take the URL found in the <b>POST incoming for EWS Office 365 to this location</b> field and place it in the <b>Redirect URIs</b> field mentioned above. After doing so the URL should look something like this:
<br><br>
https://&lt;phantom_host&gt;/rest/handler/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/&lt;asset_name&gt;
<br><br>
Additionally, updating the Base URL in the Phantom Company Settings is also required. Navigate to <b>Administration > Company Settings > Info</b> to configure the Base URL For Phantom Appliance. Then, select <b>Save Changes</b>.
<br><br>
<b>Azure Interactive</b> is different because it will prompt the user to log in through Microsoft's portal during Test Connectivity, meaning you do not need to enter your password in the asset configuration. Instead:
<ul>
  <li>Run <b>TEST CONNECTIVITY</b></li>
  <li>You will be asked to open a link in a new tab. Open the link in the same browser so that you are logged into Splunk Phantom for the redirect</li>
  <li>Proceed to login to the Microsoft site</li>
  <li>You will be prompted to agree to the permissions requested by the App</li>
  <li>If all goes well the browser should instruct you to close the tab</li>
  <li>Now go back and check the message on the Test Connectivity dialog box, it should say Connectivity test passed</li>
</ul>
Do note that if you wish to use a single login user to read and modify multiple mailboxes (of multiple users), proper permissions to allow impersonation must be enabled on the login user
    </p>
    <h3 id="federated">Federated</h3>
    <p>
    Federated Authentication setup is quite complicated and its documentation is out of the scope of this section.<br>
    NOTE: Federated Authentication has been tested in a limited fashion.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        It is not uncommon for enterprises to have a single mailbox configured where users can forward suspicious emails for further investigation. The ingestion feature in the Office 365 app is primarily designed to pull emails from such a mailbox and create containers and artifacts in Phantom.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first thing to do is create the Office 365 asset in Phantom and fill up the required various parameters like <b>url, username, password</b>, and <b>poll_user</b>. The other values can be left in the default state for now. The same user can be used to log in/authenticate and for polling, just specify the same email address in <b>poll_user</b> and <b>username</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="/app_resource/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/img/asset_settings.png">
        <img src="/app_resource/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/img/asset_settings.png"/>
    </a>
    </p>
    <p>
    <br>
    However, it's good practice to set the Label of the objects from this source to a 'NEW ENTRY' called <b>Email</b>.
    <br>
    <a href="/app_resource/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/img/ingest_settings.png">
        <img src="/app_resource/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/img/ingest_settings.png"/>
      </a><br>
    <p>
    Once the asset is saved, run Test Connectivity and make sure it passes. The Test Connectivity action attempts to read some information about the configured user's mailbox to validate the Auth parameters. Exchange Web Services API is used for all the actions. Impersonation is also used if configured.<br>
    <a href="/app_resource/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/img/testing_connectivity.png">
        <img src="/app_resource/ewsforoffice365_a73f6d32-c9d5-4fec-b024-43876700daa6/img/testing_connectivity.png"/>
    </a>
    </p>
    <p>
    <br>
    Now that the config is out of the way, let's delve into the two modes that ingestion can occur and the differences between them. One thing to note is that for every email that is ingested, a single container is created containing multiple artifacts.
    </a>
<h2 id="impersonation">Impersonation</h2>
    <p>
    If impersonation is not working, you may need to enable it by configuring the roles for the user.
    <ul>
        <li>First, log in to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/">https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/</a> as an admin user</li>
        <li>Click on <b>admin roles</b> under the <b>permissions</b> section</li>
        <li>Press the '+' button on the top left to create a new role group</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Give the group a friendly name and description</li>
                <li>Add the role <b>ApplicationImpersonation</b></li>
                <li>Assign the user to the members of this group</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Click save, and wait. These changes will take a while to affect. You may need to wait up to an hour for impersonation to start working in the App</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
<h2 id="poll_now">POLL NOW</h2>
    POLL NOW should be used to get a sense of the containers and artifacts that are created by the app. The POLL NOW window allows the user to set the "Maximum containers" that should be ingested at this instance. Since a single container is created for each email, this value equates to the maximum emails that are ingested by the app. The app will either get the oldest email first or the latest, depending upon the configuration parameter <i>How to ingest</i>. The date used to determine the oldest or latest is what EWS calls <b>item:LastModifiedTime</b>. This value is different than the mail creation time. For example, if an email that arrived a week ago, is moved from one folder to the folder being ingested, its LastModifiedTime will be set to the time that it was moved.
    </p>
<h2 id="scheduled_polling">Scheduled Polling</h2>
    <p>
       This mode is used to schedule a polling action on the asset at regular intervals, which is configured via the INGEST SETTINGS tab of the asset. It makes use of the following asset configuration parameters (among others):

    <ul>
    <li>Maximum emails to poll the first time</li>
        The app detects the first time it is polling an asset and will ingest this number of emails (at the most).
    <li>Maximum emails to poll</li>
        For all scheduled polls after the first, the app will ingest this number of emails.
    <li>How to ingest</li>
        Should the app be ingesting the latest emails or the oldest.
    </ul>
    <p>In the case of Scheduled Polling, on every poll, the app remembers the last email that it has ingested and will pick up from the next one in the next scheduled poll.</p>
    <h3>How to ingest</h3>
    <p>The app allows the user to configure how it should ingest emails on every scheduled poll either in the <i>oldest first</i> or the <i>latest first</i> order. Depending upon the scheduled interval and how busy the folder is, one of the following could potentially happen</p>
    <ul>
    <li>oldest first</li>
        If the app is configured to poll too slowly and the folder is so busy that on every poll the maximum ingested emails is less than the number of new emails, the app will never catch up.
    <li>latest first</li>
        If the app is configured to poll too slowly and the folder is so busy that on every poll the maximum ingested emails is less than the number of new emails, the app will drop the older emails since it is ingesting the latest emails that came into the mailbox.
    </ul>
    For best results, keep the poll interval and <i>Maximum emails to poll</i> values close to the number of emails you would get within a time interval. This way, every poll will end up ingesting all the new emails.<br>
    <p>In case the asset is configured to poll <b>oldest first</b>, it becomes important that the <i>Maximum number of emails to poll</i> configured should be greater than the maximum number of emails generated <b>per second</b>. If the app detects it got the maximum configured emails and all occurred in the same second, it will start polling from the next second in the next polling cycle.
    </p>
<h2>Containers created</h2>
    <p>
       As mentioned before, the app will create a single container for each email that it ingests with the following properties:
      <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      The email subject is used as the name of the container. If a subject is not present the generated name is set to the unique message ID that office 365 assigns to every mail in the mailboxes</br>
      <li>Source ID</li>
          The source ID of the container will be set to the unique message id.
      <li>Data Key</li>
      The Container dictionary contains a data section that looks like the following:
      <pre>"data": { "raw_email": "...Parsed Email....", "base64encoded": False}</pre>
      If the App decides to encode the raw_email in base64, the <i>base64encoded</i> key will be set to True
      </ul>
<h2>Artifacts created</h2>
    <p>
       The app will create the following type of artifacts:
      <ul>
      <li>Email Artifact</li>
      The email addresses that are found in the ingested email will be added as a separate artifact. Any attached email will also be scanned and the address present in the attached email will be added as a separate artifact. The emails are added as custom strings in the cef structure in the following manner.
    <br>
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <td><b>Artifact Field</b></td>
          <td><b>Value Details</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>fromEmail</td>
          <td>The email address of the sender</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>fromName</td>
          <td>The username of the sender of the email.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>toEmail</td>
          <td>The email address of the receiver of the email</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>toName</td>
          <td>The user name of the receiver of the email</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>headers</td>
          <td>A dictionary containing each email header as a key and its value as the key-value</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <br>

    </a>
    <li>IP Artifact
        <ul>
            <li>If <b>extract_ips</b> is enabled, any IPv4 or IPv6 found in the email body will be added, with one CEF per IP.</li>
            <li>Any IP addresses found in the email are added to the CEF structure of an artifact.</li>
            <li>The CEF for an IP is cef.sourceAddress.</li>

    </li>
    <li>Hash Artifact - cef.fileHash</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If <b>extract_hashes</b> is enabled, any hash found in the email body will be added, with one CEF per hash.</li>
            <li>Any Hashes found in the email are added to the CEF structure of an artifact.</li>
            <li>The CEF for a hash is cef.fileHash.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>URL Artifact - cef.requestURL</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If <b>extract_urls</b> is enabled, any url found in the email body will be added, with one CEF per url.</li>
            <li>Any URLs found are added to the CEF structure of an artifact.</li>
            <li>The CEF for a URL is cef.requestURL.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Domain Artifact - cef.destinationDnsDomain</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If <b>extract_domains</b> is enabled, any domain found in the email body will be added, with one CEF per domain.</li>
            <li>Domains that are part of a URL or an email address are added to the CEF structure of an artifact.</li>
            <li>The CEF for a URL is cef.destinationDnsDomain.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
      <li>Vault Artifact
        <ul>
          <li>If the email contains any attachments, these are extracted (if <b>extract_attachments</b> is enabled) and added to the vault of the Container.</li>
          <li>At the same time, the vault ID and file name of this item is represented by a Vault Artifact.</li>
          <li>The same file can be added to the vault multiple times. In this scenario, the file name of the item added the second time onwards will be slightly different, but the vault ID will still be the same. However, there will be multiple artifacts created.</li>
          <li>Do note that the system does <i>not</i> duplicate the file bytes, only the metadata in the database.
          <table style="width:100%">
            <tr>
              <td><b>Artifact Field</b></td>
              <td><b>Value Details</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Source ID</td>

            </tr>
          </table></li>
            <li>You will notice additional CEF fields <b>cs6</b> (value is the Vault ID) and <b>cs6Label</b>. These are added for backward compatibility only and will be deprecated in future releases. Please don't use these keys in playbooks.</li>

      </ul>
    </a>
    </p>

  <h2>Guidelines to provide folder path parameter value</h2>
    <p>This is applicable to 'copy email', 'move email', and 'run query' actions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To specify the complete path, use the <b>'/'</b> (forward slash) as the separator.</li>
      <li>If a folder name has a literal forward slash in the name escape it with a <b>'\'</b> (backslash) to differentiate.</li>
      <li>For example, to search in a folder named <b>test/exp</b> which is nested within (is a child of) <b>Inbox</b>, set the value as <b>Inbox/test\/exp</b>.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Preprocessing Containers</h3>
<p>
It is possible to upload your own script which has functions to handle preprocessing of containers.
The artifacts which are going to be added with the container can be accessed through this container as well.
This function should accept a container and return the updated container. Also note that the name of this function
must be <b>preprocess_container</b>.
<pre class="shell">
<code>
import urlparse


def get_host_from_url(url):
    return urlparse.urlparse(url).hostname


def preprocess_container(container):

    # Match urls like https://secure.contoso.com/link/https://www.google.com
    # We want to strip 'https://secure.contoso.com/link/', and instead create
    #  a URL artifact for 'https://www.google.com'
    url_prepend = 'https://secure.contoso.com/link/'
    domain_prepend = 'secure.contoso.com'

    new_artifacts = []

    for artifact in container.get('artifacts', []):
        cef = artifact.get('cef')
        url = cef.get('requestURL')
        if url and url.lower().startswith(url_prepend):
            url = url.replace(url_prepend, '')
            artifact['cef']['requestURL'] = url
            # Create a new domain artifact for this URL
            new_artifacts.append({
                'name': 'Domain Artifact',
                'cef': {
                    'destinationDnsDomain': get_host_from_url(url)
                }
            })

        domain = cef.get('destinationDnsDomain')
        if domain and domain.lower() == domain_prepend:
            # These are the wrong domains, ignore them
            continue

        new_artifacts.append(artifact)

    if new_artifacts:
        new_artifacts[-1]['run_automation'] = True

    container['artifacts'] = new_artifacts
    return container
</code>
</pre>
In this example, many of the URLs have 'https://secure.contoso.com/link' appended to the start of them.
These URL artifacts will be tough to use in a playbook without additional processing. On top of that, all
of the associated domain artifacts will be incorrect as well, since they will all point to 'secure.contoso.com'.
</p>

<h2>Port Information</h2>
<p>
    The app uses HTTP/ HTTPS protocol for communicating with the Office365 server. Below are the default ports used by Splunk SOAR.
    <table>
        <tr class=plain>
            <th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service Name</th>
            <th>Transport Protocol</th>
            <th>Port</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http</td>
            <td>tcp</td>
            <td>80</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https</td>
            <td>tcp</td>
            <td>443</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</p>
